	<div class="prose">
		<p>
			LxMerit is building infrastructure for merit-based learning. We believe education should be
			measured by what students actually know and can do — not seat time or credentials.
		</p>

		<h2>What We're Building</h2>

		<p>
			<strong>L(earn)²</strong> — An AI-powered classical education platform that combines
			rigorous curriculum with intelligent tutoring. Students learn from the best content
			(Hillsdale College curriculum, classical sources) with AI tutors that adapt to their needs.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>LxLedger</strong> — Immutable learning velocity tracking. Students own their
			achievement data. Universities and employers interpret it. Think 23andMe for learning:
			you own the data, others compete to interpret it.
		</p>

		<h2>The Equation</h2>

		<p class="text-2xl font-semibold text-center my-8">
			L(earn)<sup>2</sup> = Merit
		</p>

		<p>
			Learn to learn. Learning squared. The output is merit — demonstrable, verifiable, owned by
			the student.
		</p>

		<h2>Built in Public</h2>

		<p>
			We ship fast and document everything. Follow our <a href="/blog">Dev Diary</a> to see
			how we're building.
