	<p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
		Patrick Hardiman is a self-taught full-stack engineer and systems architect. He's spent decades
		building mission-critical systems in regulated industries — platforms that processed and shipped
		millions of orders where failure wasn't an option.
	</p>

	<p class="text-slate-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
		When he began homeschooling his twin daughters, he couldn't buy:
	</p>

	<ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2 text-slate-600 ml-4">
		<li>A transcript they actually own — one a college or employer can't dismiss as&nbsp;"mom&nbsp;grades"</li>
		<li>Proof of real mastery, not just "finished&nbsp;the&nbsp;workbook"</li>
		<li>Classical curriculum that isn't watered down, ideologically loaded, or covered in&nbsp;cartoon&nbsp;badges</li>
		<li>Adaptive pacing that respects the student instead of turning education into a dopamine&nbsp;slot&nbsp;machine</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
		LxMerit measures learning velocity — actual mastery, not seat time, not sentiment, not social
		categories. The credential belongs to the student. The merit is earned.
	</p>

		Molly and Bridget are the first users. If it doesn't work perfectly at the Hardiman kitchen
		table, it doesn't ship.
